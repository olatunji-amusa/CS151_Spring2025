Read and Write

Create a file in Week10/Lab called read_write.cpp

Write a program that reads a file called content.txt and counts the occurrences of each letter in the file.
The program should then write the letter counts to a file called counts.txt.

The output file should contain the letter counts in the following format:
A: 5
B: 3
C: 2
...
The program should ignore case and only count letters (ignore digits, punctuation, and whitespace).
The program should also handle the case where the input file does not exist or cannot be opened.
The program should print an error message if the input file cannot be opened.

01. Include the necessary header files. (iostream, fstream, cctype)
02. Define the main function.
03. Declare a variable to hold the filename of the input file.
04. Declare a variable to hold the filename of the output file.
05. Check if the input files were opened successfully.
06. If the input files were not opened successfully, print an error message and return 1.
07. Declare an array to hold the letter counts (26 elements for A-Z).
08. Initialize each letter count to 0 in the array.
09. Declare a variable to hold the character read from the input file.
10. Read each character from the input file.
11. If the character is a letter, convert it to uppercase and increment the corresponding count in the array.
    'A' - 'A' = 0
    'B' - 'A' = 1
    'C' - 'A' = 2
    ...
    'Z' - 'A' = 25
    The condition of the if header should be: if (isalpha(character))
    Or: if (toupper(character) >= 'A' && toupper(character) <= 'Z')
    Use the formula: index = toupper(character) - 'A' to get the index for the letter count array.
12. Write the letter counts to the output file in the specified format.
13. Loop from 'A' to 'Z'.
14. In each iteration, write the letter and its count to the output file.
15. Close the input file.
16. Close the output file.
17. Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.
