Create a file in Week14/Lab called clock.cpp

Write a function called showTime() that has an int parameter called hours and an int
parameter called minutes. Minutes should have a default value of 0.
Assume the hours are in the range 0-23 and the minutes are in the range 0-59.
The the function should return a string representing the time in the format 
"hh:mm AM|PM" (AM or PM) where hh is the hour in the 2 digit
12-hour format and mm is the minutes in the 2 digit format.

Write a main function that will test the above function.
The main function should call the showTime() function with the following values:
showTime(0, 0);
showTime(12, 0);
showTime(23, 59);
showTime(12, 59);
showTime(13, 30);
showTime(14);   
showTime(15);
