        by blanks.

3. What header files must be included in the following program?

    int main()
    {
        double amount = 89.7;
        cout << showpoint << fixed;
        cout << setw(8) << amount << endl;
        return 0;
    }

4. Complete the following table by determining the value of each expression.

    Expression                          Value
    28 / 4 − 2                          
    6 + 12 * 2 − 8

    6 + 17 % 3 − 2                      
    2 + 22 * (9 − 7)                    
    (8 + 7) * 2                         
    (16 + 7) % 2 − 1                    
    12 / (10 − 6)                       
    (19 − 3) * (2 + 2) / 4              

5. Write C++ expressions for the following algebraic expressions:

    a = 12x
    z = 5x + 14y + 6k
    y = x^4
    g = h + 12
        -------
          4k
    c =  a^3
        -------
        b^2k^4


6. Assume a program has the following variable definitions:
    int units;
    float mass;
    double weight;

    and the following statement:

    weight = mass * units;

    Which automatic data type conversion will take place?
    (A) mass is demoted to an int, units remains an int, and the result of mass * units
        is an int.
    (B) units is promoted to a float, mass remains a float, and the result of mass *
        units is a float.
    (C) units is promoted to a float, mass remains a float, and the result of mass *
        units is a double.

7. Assume a program has the following variable definitions:

    int a, b = 2;
    float c = 4.2;

    and the following statement:

    a = b * c;

    What value will be stored in a?
    (A) 8.4
    (B) 8
    (C) 0
    (D) None of the above

8. Assume qty and salesReps are both integers. Use a type cast expression to rewrite
    the following statement so it will no longer perform integer division.
    unitsEach = qty / salesReps;

9. Rewrite the following variable definition so that the variable is a named constant.
    int rate;

10. Complete the following table by providing statements with combined assignment
    operators for the right-hand column. The statements should be equivalent to the state-
    ments in the left-hand column.

    Statements with                     Statements with
    Assignment Operator                 Combined Assignment Operator
    x = x + 5;                          
    total = total + subtotal;           
    dist = dist / rep;                  
    ppl = ppl * period;                 
    inv = inv − shrinkage;              
    num = num % 2;                      

11. Write a multiple assignment statement that can be used instead of the following group
    of assignment statements:
    
    east = 1;
    west = 1;
    north = 1;
    south = 1;

12. Write a cout statement so the variable divSales is displayed in a field of 8 spaces, in
    fixed-point notation, with a precision of 2 decimal places. The decimal point should
    always be displayed.

13. Write a cout statement so the variable totalAge is displayed in a field of 12 spaces,
    in fixed-point notation, with a precision of 4 decimal places.

14. A variable velocity has a value of 180.67245612456. Write a cout statement to
    display it in a field of six spaces left-justified. Write another cout statement to dis-
    play it in 18 spaces with a precision of 12 decimal spaces, in fixed notation, with
    trailing zeros.
