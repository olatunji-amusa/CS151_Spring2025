fmod    pow     tan

ANSWER BELOW
*******************************************************************************
cos(x) – Computes the cosine of x, where x is in radians.
log(x) – Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.
sin(x) – Computes the sine of x, where x is in radians.
exp(x) – Calculates e raised to the power of x (e^x).
log10(x) – Returns the base-10 logarithm of x.
sqrt(x) – Computes the square root of x.
fmod(x, y) – Returns the remainder of x divided by y.
pow(x, y) – Computes x raised to the power y (x^y).
tan(x) – Computes the tangent of x, where x is in radians.
