# **CS 151 - Introduction to Computing**


[Prerequisite Software for Local Developement](setup.md)

## 1. Getting Started
- Fork this repository to your own account by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of this page.
- Once you have forked the repository, you can clone it to your local machine or open it in GitHub Codespaces.
- Click the "Code" button and copy the URL under "Local" to clone the repository to your local machine.
- If you are using GitHub Codespaces, click the "Code" button and select "Create codespace on main."

## 2. Cloning Your Repository to Your Local Machine (Skip if using GitHub Codespaces)
First time only.
- Open the terminal on your local machine.
- Go to the directory where you would to place the repository.
- Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone forked-repository-url
code CS151_Spring2025
```

## 3. Setting Up Your Environment
1. Click on "File" in the upper left corner of Visual Studio Code.
2. If you don't see "File" but see a button with three horizontal lines, click it then select "File."
3. Make "Auto Save" is checked to automatically save your work before compiling and running your C++ program.

Open terminal in Visual Studio Code or Codespaces.
- **If you are using macOs, run the following command:**
```sh
cat rc.txt >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
- **If you are using Windows or Linux, run the following command:**
```sh
cat rc.txt >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
## 4. Run the following command
```sh
./setup.sh
```

## 5. Editing Github Configuration
This is only required if you've never connected your local machine to your GitHub account.
- **Skip this step if you are using GitHub Codespaces.**
- add your github username and email to the git configuration
```sh
git config --global user.name "github-username"
git config --global user.email "github-email"
```

## Helper Aliases
- ***mec***: compiles and executes a C++ program
- ***workspace***: prints the workspace root directory to the terminal
- ***gotoworkspace***: goes to the workspace root directory
- ***g++***: modifies the g++ command to include the -std=c++23 flag

## C++ Programming
Open your repository in Visual Studio Code.
Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
- Run the following command to compile your C++ program:
```sh
g++ -o main main.cpp
```
- Run the following command to execute your C++ program:
```sh
./main
```
Above is an example of compiling and executing a C++ program named main.cpp. You can replace main.cpp with the name of your C++ program, and main with the desired output file name. (the cpp file name without the .cpp extension)

***ALTERNATIVE***

- Run the following command to compile your C++ program:
```sh
g++ main.cpp
```
- Run the following command to execute your C++ program:
```sh
./a.out
```
Above, only the name of the cpp file is required. The output file will be named a.out by default. You can replace main.cpp with the name of your C++ program.

***ALTERNATIVE***

- Run the following command to compile and execute your C++ program:
```sh
mec main.cpp
```
As stated before, mec is a helper alias that compiles and executes a C++ program. You can replace main.cpp with the name of your C++ program.

## Run Button in Visual Studio CodeCode (▶️)
You can also install Code Runner in Visual Studio Code to compile and run your C++ program with a single click.
1. Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
2. Search for "Code Runner" in the Extensions view search box.
3. Click on the Install button.
4. Click on the settings cog in the lower left corner of the window.
5. Click on Settings.
6. Search for "run in terminal."
7. Check the box for "Whether to run code in Integrated Terminal."
8. Open the C++ file you want to compile and run.
9. Click on the Run Code button (▶️) in the upper right corner of the window.
    - If there is a dropdown arrow next to the Run Code button, click on it and select "Run Code."
    - Afterwards, clicking the (▶️) button will default to "Run Code."
10. The output of your C++ program will be displayed in a new terminal named "Code."

## Committing Your Work
Your work will be saved on your local machine or GitHub Codespaces. However, it is essential to save your work to your GitHub repository to keep it safe and accessible from anywhere.
- To save your work to your GitHub repository, run the following commands:
```sh
gotoworkspace
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "commit-message"
git push
```
***OR***
```sh
gotoworkspace
./gpush.sh
```
You can pass a custom commit message after ./gpush.sh using the following command:
```sh
./gpush.sh "commit-message"
```

## Fetching Updates from the Original Repository
Whenever you want to update your repository with the latest changes from the original repository:
```sh
gotoworkspace
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
***OR***
```sh
gotoworkspace
./gfetch.sh
```
