1. Create a file in the Week02/Lab/ folder called mygrade.cpp
2. The program should have 2 variables, one for the number grade and one for the letter grade.
3. Assign the number grade the value you expect to get in this class.
4. Assign the letter grade the value of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F' based on the number grade.
5. Output the number grade and the letter grade in a descriptive sentence.
6. Test the program and make sure it works.
7. Push your changes to GitHub

For reference, the grading scale is:
90 - 100 = A
80 - 89 = B
70 - 79 = C
60 - 69 = D
0 - 59 = F
