1. Create a file in the Week04/Lab/ folder called middle.cpp
2. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and then prints the middle number.
3. The program should have 3 variables,
    num1, num2, and middle.
4. Test the program with the following numbers:
    num1 = 2, num2 = 72
    The output should be:
    middle = 37
    
    num1 = -10, num2 = -20
    The output should be:
    middle = -15
    
    num1 = -100, num2 = 100
    The output should be:
    middle = 0

5. After displaying the middle number, assign the numbers 
    2147483640 and 2147483646 to num1 and num2, respectively.
6. Output the middle number again.
7. The output should be: 2147483643
