1. Create a file in the Week04/Lab/ folder called hypotenuse.cpp
2. Write a program that asks the user for the lengths
    of the two sides of a right triangle and then prints the length of the hypotenuse.
3. The program should have 3 variables,
    side_a, side_b, and side_c.
4. a^2 + b^2 = c^2
5. side_c = c = hypotenuse
6. Include the cmath library: #include <cmath>
7. Use the sqrt() function to calculate the hypotenuse
8. Use of the pow() function is optional
9. Test the program with the following sides:
    side_a = 3, side_b = 4
    The output should be:
    side_c = 5

    side_a = 5, side_b = 12
    The output should be:
    side_c = 13

    side_a = 8, side_b = 15
    The output should be:
    side_c = 17
