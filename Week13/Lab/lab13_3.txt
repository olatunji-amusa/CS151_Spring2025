Write a boolean function called validPin() that has a constant string reference parameter
    called pin and returns true if the pin is a 4-digit number, and false otherwise.
    The function should check if the pin is a 4-digit number by checking if it contains
    only digits and has a length of 4.

Write a boolean function called changePIN() that has a string reference parameter
    called currentPin and a constant string reference parameter called newPin.
    The function should validate the new PIN by checking if it is a 4-digit number.
    If the new PIN is valid and not equal to the current PIN the function should 
    update the string reference parameter with the new PIN and return true.
    If the new PIN is invalid or equal to the current PIN, the function should return false.

Write a boolean function called deposit() that has a double reference parameter
    called balance and a double parameter called amount.
    The function should check if the amount is positive. If it is, the function should
    add the amount to the balance and return true. If the amount is negative, the function
    should return false.

Write a boolean function called withdraw() that has a double reference parameter
    called balance and a double parameter called amount.
    The function should check if the amount is positive and less than or equal to the balance.
    If it is, the function should subtract the amount from the balance and return true.
    If the amount is negative or greater than the balance, the function should return false.

Write a main function that declares a string variable called pin and initializes it to "1234".
    The function should declare a double variable called balance and initializes it to 1000.0.
    The function should call the changePIN() function with the current PIN and a new PIN of your choice.
    If the function returns true, print "PIN changed successfully" to the console.
    If the function returns false, print "PIN change failed" to the console.
    The function should call the deposit() function with the balance and an amount of your choice.
    If the function returns true, print "Deposit successful" to the console.
    If the function returns false, print "Deposit failed" to the console.
    The function should call the withdraw() function with the balance and an amount of your choice.
    If the function returns true, print "Withdrawal successful" to the console.
    If the function returns false, print "Withdrawal failed" to the console.
    The function should print the final balance to the console.
