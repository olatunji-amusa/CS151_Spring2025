Create a file in your Week08/Lab folder called math.cpp
Write a program that generates a math exercise for the user.

The program should first ask for which operation an exercise should be generated. The
possibilities are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

After selecting an operation, the user should answer the following question:
    What is the maximum value for the input values of the exercise?

The answer to this question must be stored in a variable maximumValue.

Next, the program should ask
    Are negative values allowed in the exercise?
    
The possible answers for the question are “Y” and “N”.

The program will then generate two random numbers. If the user allows negative
values, the random numbers must be generated in the range from –maximumValue to
+maximumValue; if the user allows only positive values, the range is restricted from 0
to maximumValue. Moreover, if only positive numbers are allowed and subtraction
was chosen, the second random value must be less than the first random value.

Finally, the program will show the generated exercise, depending on the chosen
operation and the numbers randomly generated, and ask the user for the correct solu-
tion. If the user solves the exercise correctly, the program will print out a congratula-
tory message.
